    <p class="description">
      The best things in life are often the simplest — and this fresh cranberry
      sauce, made with just three ingredients, is proof.
    </p>
    <ul class="ingredients">
      <li>1 cup water</li>
      <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1 (12 ounce) package fresh cranberries (such as Ocean Spray®)</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring water to a boil in a saucepan; add sugar and cook until sugar is
        dissolved, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <p></p>
      <li>
        Stir cranberries into the saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to
        low, and simmer until cranberries have popped and sauce is chunky, about
        10 minutes or longer for desired consistency. The longer you cook it,
        the less chunky it will be.
      </li>
      <p></p>
      <li>
        Pour sauce into a serving dish or jars and cover until ready to use; the
        pectin in the cranberries will make the cranberry sauce gel as it cools.
      </li>
      <p></p>
      <li>Mix cranberry sauce with a fork before serving.</li>
      <p></p>
    </ol>
